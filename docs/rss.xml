      <title>Sentinel-2 L2A 120m Mosaic</title>
      <link>https://developer1510.github.io/OpenDataRegistry/sentinel-s2-l2a-mosaic-120</link>
      <guid>https://developer1510.github.io/OpenDataRegistry/sentinel-s2-l2a-mosaic-120</guid>
      <description>Sentinel-2 L2A 120m mosaic is a derived product, which contains best pixel values for 10-daily periods, modelled by removing the cloudy pixels and then performing interpolation among remaining values. As there are some parts of the world, which have lengthy cloudy periods, clouds might be remaining in some parts. The actual modelling script is available &lt;a href&#x3D;&quot;https://sentinel-hub.github.io/custom-scripts/sentinel-2/interpolated_time_series/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

      <title>Global Land Cover</title>
      <link>https://developer1510.github.io/OpenDataRegistry/global-land-cover</link>
      <guid>https://developer1510.github.io/OpenDataRegistry/global-land-cover</guid>
      <description>Global Land Cover products at 100 m resolution are delivered annually by the &lt;a href&#x3D;&quot;https://land.copernicus.eu/global/products/lc&quot;&gt;global component of the Copernicus Land Service&lt;/a&gt;. The most recent collection 3 (version 3.0.1) of 100 m Land Cover products for the years 2015 - 2019 were generated from the PROBA-V 100 m and 300 m satellite observations and several other ancillary datasets with global coverage. These Land Cover products provide a main discrete land cover classification map according to UN-FAO Land Cover Classification System &lt;a href&#x3D;&quot;https://land.copernicus.eu/global/products/lc&quot;&gt;LCCS&lt;/a&gt;. Additional continuous fractional layers for all basic land cover classes which give the percentage of a 100 m pixel that is filled with a specific land cover class, are also included in the Land Cover products to provide more detailed information on each land cover class.</description>

      <title>Sentinel-2 L1C</title>
      <link>https://developer1510.github.io/OpenDataRegistry/sentinel-2-l1c</link>
      <guid>https://developer1510.github.io/OpenDataRegistry/sentinel-2-l1c</guid>
      <description>The &lt;a href&#x3D;&quot;https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-2&quot;&gt;Sentinel-2 mission&lt;/a&gt; is
a land monitoring constellation of two satellites that provide high resolution
optical imagery and provide continuity for the current SPOT and Landsat missions.
The mission provides a global coverage of the Earth&amp;#39;s land surface every 5 days,
making the data of great use in on-going studies. L1C data are available from
June 2015 globally. L2A data are available from September 2016 over wider Europe
region and globally since January 2017. </description>
