These Land Cover products provide a main discrete land cover classification map according to UN-FAO Land Cover Classification System [LCCS](https://land.copernicus.eu/global/products/lc). Additional continuous fractional layers for all basic land cover classes which give the percentage of a 100 m pixel that is filled with a specific land cover class, are also included in the Land Cover products to provide more detailed information on each land cover class.","AdditionalInfo":"[Additional info](corine-land-cover/README.MD)","Resolution":"100m","GeographicalCoverage":"Global coverage of land surface area with longitude from 180°W to 180°E and latitude from 78.25°N to 60°S.","TemporalAvailability":"2015 - ongoing","UpdateFrequency":"Annualy.","BandInformation":"Discrete_Classification_map, Discrete_Classification_proba, Forest_Type_layer, Bare_CoverFraction_layer, Crops_CoverFraction_layer, Grass_CoverFraction_layer, MossLichen_CoverFraction_layer, Shrub_CoverFraction_layer, Snow_CoverFraction_layer, Tree_CoverFraction_layer, BuiltUp_CoverFraction_layer, PermanentWater_CoverFraction_layer, SeasonalWater_CoverFraction_layer, DataDensityIndicator, Change_Confidence_layer","Contact":"[Copernicus Land Monitoring Service Contact](https://land.copernicus.eu/contact)","Provider":"[European Commission Joint Research Centre (JRC)](https://land.copernicus.eu/global/about)","ManagedBy":"[Sentinel Hub](https://www.sentinel-hub.com/)","Tags":["CLMS","derived data","land cover","machine learning"],"License":"free and open access policy as defined in the European Union’s Copernicus regulation ([details](https://land.copernicus.eu/global/about))\n","Resources":[{"EndPoint":"creodias.sentinel-hub.com","Type":"byoc-f0a97620-0e88-4c1f-a1ac-bb388fabdf2c","CollectionId":"f0a97620-0e88-4c1f-a1ac-bb388fabdf2c"}],"RegistryEntryAdded":"2021-03-20","RegistryEntryLastModified":"2021-03-21","Slug":"global-land-cover","Sources":["awslabs-open-data-registry"],"rootUrl":"https://developer1510.github.io/OpenDataRegistry/","githubRepo":"Developer1510/OpenDataRegistry","githubBranch":"master"}
