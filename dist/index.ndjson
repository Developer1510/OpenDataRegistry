Agriculture-Vision aims to be a publicly available large-scale aerial agricultural image dataset that is high-resolution, multi-band, and with multiple types of patterns annotated by agronomy experts. In its current stage, we have captured 94,986 512x512images sampled from 3,432 farmlands with nine types of annotations: double plant, drydown, endrow, nutrient deficiency, planter skip, storm damage, water, waterway and weed cluster. All of these patterns have substantial impacts on field conditions and the final yield. These farmland images were captured between 2017 and 2019 across multiple growing seasons in numerous farming locations in the US. Each field image contains four color channels: Near-infrared (NIR), Red, Green and Blue.  We first randomly split the 3,432 farmland images with a 6/2/2 train/val/test ratio. We then assign each sampled image to the split of the farmland image they are cropped from. This guarantees that no cropped images from the same farmland will appear in multiple splits in the final dataset. The generated Agriculture-Vision dataset thus contains 56,944/18,334/19,708 train/val/test images.","Documentation":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.01306","Contact":"support@intelinair.com","ManagedBy":"IntelinAir, Inc.","UpdateFrequency":"Periodically","Tags":["aerial imagery","agriculture","computer vision","deep learning"],"License":"Provided in the bucket.","Resources":[{"Description":"Terms of use and paper provided.

The goal\nof ENCODE is to build a comprehensive parts list of functional elements in the human genome,\nincluding elements that act at the protein and RNA levels, and regulatory elements that\ncontrol cells and circumstances in which a gene is active. ENCODE investigators employ a\nvariety of assays and methods to identify functional elements. The discovery and annotation\nof gene elements is accomplished primarily by sequencing a diverse range of RNA sources,\ncomparative genomics, integrative bioinformatic methods, and human curation. Regulatory\nelements are typically investigated through DNA hypersensitivity assays, assays of\nDNA methylation, and immunoprecipitation (IP) of proteins that interact with DNA and RNA,\ni.e., modified histones, transcription factors, chromatin regulators, and\nRNA-binding proteins, followed by sequencing.\n","Contact":"encode-help@lists.stanford.edu","ManagedBy":"ENCODE Data Coordinating Center","Documentation":"https://www.encodeproject.org","UpdateFrequency":"Daily","Tags":["aws-pds","bioinformatics","biology","deep learning","genetic","genomic","life sciences","machine learning"],"License":"External data users may freely download, analyze, and publish results based on any ENCODE data without restrictions.","Resources":[{"Description":"Released and archived ENCODE data","ARN":"arn:aws:s3:::encode-public","Region":"us-west-2","Type":"S3 Bucket"}],"DataAtWork":{"Tutorials":[{"Title":"ENCODE CTCF ChIP-seq data correlation across different cell types","URL":"https://github.com/ENCODE-DCC/encode-data-usage-examples/blob/master/ctcf_chip_seq_cross_cell_type_correlation.ipynb","AuthorName":"Paul Sud","AuthorURL":"https://github.com/p-sud"},{"Title":"Exploring ENCODE data from EC2 with Jupyter notebook","URL":"https://github.com/ENCODE-DCC/encode-data-usage-examples/blob/master/mount_s3_bucket_and_run_jupyter_on_ec2.ipynb","AuthorName":"Keenan Graham","AuthorURL":"https://github.com/keenangraham"},{"Title":"Ingesting ENCODE data into TileDB with S3 backend","URL":"https://github.com/ENCODE-DCC/encode-data-usage-examples/blob/master/ingest_encode_data_tile_db_with_s3_backend.ipynb","AuthorName":"Otto Jolanki","AuthorURL":"https://github.com/ottojolanki"}],"Publications":[{"Title":"New developments on the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) data portal","URL":"https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/48/D1/D882/5622708#190992715","AuthorName":"Luo et al 2020","AuthorURL":"http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6948-2042"}]},"RegistryEntryAdded":"2019-04-09","RegistryEntryLastModified":"2020-01-31","Slug":"encode-project","Sources":["awslabs-open-data-registry"]}

Run by the [Folding@home Consortium](https://foldingathome.org/about/the-foldinghome-consortium/), a worldwide network of research laboratories focusing on a variety of different diseases, Folding@home seeks to address problems in human health on a scale that is infeasible by another other means, sharing the results of these large-scale studies with the research community through [peer-reviewed publications](https://foldingathome.org/papers-results/) and publicly shared datasets. During the [COVID-19 epidemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019), Folding@home focused its resources on understanding the vulernabilities in [SARS-CoV-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome_coronavirus_2), the virus that causes COVID-19 disease, and working closely with a number of experimental collaborators to accelerate progress toward effective therapies for treating COVID-19 and ending the pandemic. In the process, it created the world's first [exascale distributed computing resource](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.27.175430), enabling it to generate valuable scientific datasets of unprecedented size. More information about Folding@home's COVID-19 research activities at the [Folding@home COVID-19 page](https://foldingathome.org/diseases/infectious-diseases/covid-19/).

The vehicles The vehicles were manually driven on an average route of 66 km in Michigan that included a mix of driving scenarios like the Detroit Airport, freeways, city-centres, university campus and suburban neighbourhood, etc. Each vehicle used in this data collection  is a Ford Fusion outfitted with an Applanix POS-LV inertial measurement unit (IMU), four HDL-32E Velodyne 3D-lidar scanners, 6 Point Grey 1.3 MP Cameras arranged on the rooftop for 360 degree coverage and 1 Pointgrey 5 MP camera mounted behind the windsheild for forward field of view. We present the seasonal variation in weather, lighting, construction and traffic conditions experienced in dynamic urban environments. This dataset can help design robust algorithms for autonomous vehicles and multi-agent systems. Each log in the dataset is time-stamped and contains raw data from all the sensors, calibration values, pose trajectory, ground truth pose, and 3D maps.

In 2018, Kids First launched the Gabriella Miller Kids First Data Resource Center, charged with building a large-scale data platform supporting clinical and genetic data from these patients and their families in order to accelerate discovery and ultimately clinical impact. Researchers can search, access, aggregate, and analyze these data through the Kids First Data Resource Portal. Additionally, by using cloud-based individual workspaces in CAVATICA, a data analysis and sharing computation platform, researchers can cross-analyze Kids First data with data from other efforts, such as NCI’s TARGET program and consortia-based datasets like the Children’s Brain Tumor Tissue Consortium (CBTTC).\nKids First is made available on AWS via the [NIH STRIDES

{"Name":"NOAA Global Extratropical Surge and Tide Operational Forecast System (Global ESTOFS)","Description":"NOAA's Global Extratropical Surge and Tide Operational Forecast System (Global ESTOFS) provides users with nowcasts (analyses of near present conditions) and forecast guidance of water level conditions for the entire globe. Global ESTOFS has been developed to serve the marine navigation, weather forecasting, and disaster mitigation user communities. Global ESTOFS was developed in a collaborative effort between the NOAA/National Ocean Service (NOS)/Office of Coast Survey, the NOAA/National Weather Service (NWS)/National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Central Operations (NCO), the University of Notre Dame, the University of North Carolina, and The Water Institute of the Gulf. The model generates forecasts out to 180 hours four times per day; forecast output includes water levels caused by the combined effects of storm surge and tides, by astronomical tides alone, and by sub-tidal water levels (isolated storm surge). <br /><br />\n\nThe hydrodynamic model employed by Global ESTOFS is the ADvanced CIRCulation (ADCIRC) finite element model. The model is forced by GFS winds, mean sea level pressure, and sea ice. The unstructured grid used by Global ESTOFS consists of 8,063,409 nodes and 15,478,900 triangular elements. Coastal resolution is up to 80 m for Hawaii and the U.S. West Coast; up to 90-120 m for the Pacific Islands including Guam, American Samoa, Marianas, Wake Island, Marshall Islands, and Palau; and up to 120 m for the U.S. East Coast, Puerto Rico, Micronesia, and Alaska. The flood plain extends overland to approximately 6 m elevation ASL for the U.S. East Coast, and up to 20 m elevation ASL for the Pacific Islands. Global ESTOFS a) reduces bias and errors due to the removal of the open ocean boundaries that were included in previous ESTOFS regional domains (ESTOFS-Atlantic, -Pacific, -Micronesia); b) includes internal tide-induced dissipation in the deep ocean; c) includes sea ice effect on wind drag, and d) incorporates a bias correction using 2-day average water level observations from CO-OPS tide stations that are interpolated spatially across the Global ESTOFS mesh. <br /><br />\n\nGlobal ESTOFS water level forecast guidance output available here include NetCDF, GRIB2, and SHEF files.

This collection of data contains surface water currents forecast guidance from [NOAA/NOS Operational Forecast Systems](https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/models.html), a set of operational hydrodynamic nowcast and forecast modeling systems, for various U.S. coastal waters and the great lakes. The collection also contains surface current forecast guidance output from the [NCEP Global Real-Time Ocean Forecast System (GRTOFS)](https://polar.ncep.noaa.gov/global/) for some offshore areas. These datasets are encoded as HDF-5 files conforming to the S-111 specification, and are geospatially subset into individual tiles conforming to the NOAA/OCS Nautical Product Tiling Scheme, with filenames indicating the corresponding NOAA Electronic Navigational Chart (ENC) Cell Identifier.\nA full set of S-111 tiles is created for each new model run cycle, which occurs four times per day for all models except for RTOFS, which updates only once per day. Files are organized using a path naming convention that includes the OFS identifier (e.g. 'cbofs' corresponding with output from the Chesapeake Bay Operational Forecast System) as well as the year, month, day, and hour corresponding with each model run initialization time. Each individual S-111 (HDF-5) file contains all forecast projections from a single model run for that geographic area. In other words, a single S-111 file will contain multiple gridded arrays each containing a forecast valid at a distinct time in the future, out to the forecast horizon of the underlying modeling system. All surface currents forecasts in this collection are computed at a depth of 4.5 meters below water surface, or half the water column depth, whichever is shallower.\n","Documentation":"https://noaa-s111-pds.s3.amazonaws.com/README.html","Contact":"For general questions or feedback about the data, please submit inquiries through the NOAA Office of Coast Survey (OCS) ASSIST Tool at https://www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/customer-service/assist/.\"\n<br />\nFor any questions regarding data delivery not associated with this platform or any general questions regarding the NOAA Big Data Program, email noaa.bdp@noaa.gov.\n<br /> We also seek to identify case studies on how NOAA data is being used and will be featuring those stories in joint publications and in upcoming events.

{"Name":"National Renewable Energy Laboratory's (NREL) PV Rooftop Database","Description":"Released to the public as part of the Department of Energy's Open Energy Data Initiative, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's (NREL) PV Rooftop Database (PVRDB) is a lidar-derived, geospatially-resolved dataset of suitable roof surfaces and their PV technical potential for 128 metropolitan regions in the United States. The source lidar data and building footprints were obtained by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Homeland Security Infrastructure Program for 2006-2014. Using GIS methods, NREL identified suitable roof surfaces based on their size, orientation, and shading parameters Gagnon et al. 2016. Standard 2015 technical potential was then estimated for each plane using NREL's System Advisor Model.  The PVRDB is down-loadable by city and year of lidar collection. Five geospatial layers are available for each city and year: 1) the raster extent of the lidar collection, 2) buildings identified from the lidar data, 3) suitable developable planes for each building, 4) aspect values of the developable planes, and 5) the technical potential estimates of the developable planes. The first and current version of the PVRDB is derived from 2006-2014, 1-meter lidar data from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security for 128 metropolitan regions. Suitability is defined as any roof area that is less than 60 degrees in tilt; has an orientation facing east, southeast, south, southwest, or west; is in sunlight for a minimum number of hours per day (determined uniquely for each region); and has at least 10 m2 of contiguous area that meets the above listed criteria. Technical potential estiamtes were estimated using SAM, with NSRDB v1 as the underlying resource data. Technical parameters assumed a 2015 typical residential PV rooftop system.","Documentation":"https://github.com/openEDI/documentation/blob/master/PVROOFTOPS.md","Contact":"https://github.com/openEDI/documentation/issues","ManagedBy":"[National Renewable Energy Laboratory](https://www.nrel.gov/)","UpdateFrequency":"This dataset is composed of historical data only.

{"Name":"Natural Scenes Dataset","Description":"Here, we collected and pre-processed a massive, high-quality 7T fMRI dataset that can be used to advance our understanding of how the brain works. A unique feature of this dataset is the massive amount of data available per individual subject. The data were acquired using ultra-high-field fMRI (7T, whole-brain, 1.8-mm resolution, 1.6-s TR). We measured fMRI responses while each of 8 participants viewed 9,000–10,000 distinct, color natural scenes (22,500–30,000 trials) in 30–40 weekly scan sessions over the course of a year. Additional measures were collected including resting-state data, retinotopy, category localizers, anatomical data (T1, T2, diffusion, venogram, angiogram), physiological data (pulse, respiration), eye-tracking data, and additional behavioral assessments outside the scanner. Because of its unprecedented scale and richness, NSD can be used to explore diverse neuroscientific questions with high power at the level of individual subjects. In particular, the number of images sampled in this dataset is sufficiently large that the dataset may be of high interest for computer vision, machine learning, and other data-driven applications.","Documentation":"To receive access to the NSD Data Manual, please fill out the [NSD Data Access Agreement Form](https://forms.gle/xue2bCdM9LaFNMeb7).","Contact":"info@cvnlab.net","ManagedBy":"[Computational Visual Neuroscience Laboratory](http://cvnlab.net) at the [Center for Magnetic Resonance Research](http://www.cmrr.umn.edu)","UpdateFrequency":"Currently in preparation.

The reanalysis data\ncan be used to infer flow frequencies and perform temporal analyses\nwith hourly streamflow output and 3-hourly land surface output. The\nlong-term dataset can also be used in the development of end user\napplications which require a long baseline of data for system\ntraining or verification purposes. This dataset contains output from two\nretrospective simulations.

{"Deprecated":true,"Name":"21st Century Daily Global Seamless Remote Sensing Data Cubes (SDCs)","Description":"By constructing a virtual constellation of complementary types of satellites, we integrated the merit of high spatial resolution Landsat data with that of high temporal frequency MODIS data, to produce a high spatial-resolution and temporally consistent, better data set overcoming a number of shortcomings that conventional Earth observation (EO) data have, including cloud effects, data damage or loss. To do so, we developed a spatial-temporal remote sensing data reconstruction and fusion framework with an automated, serverless production chain on the AWS. Based on it, we produced the seamless data cube (SDC) at a 30 m spatial resolution and daily interval in an analysis-ready-data (ARD) format. The constructed fine-grained SDC will significantly reduce the preprocessing burden of users, broaden the use of remotely sensed data to a wider range of communities, and give us the capacity of near-real-time EO. Such kind of data is a long-term dream in the remote sensing and application community, that has never been realized before. The data set will promote new knowledge discovery on patterns, and benefit the land science community for biophysical, and socio-economic information extraction from the ARD data, making it easy and convenient to assess various policy goals such as conservation of protected areas, supporting international policy making on climate change mitigation, and raising awareness on environmental issues. The knowledge gained from this uniquely comprehensive data set will form a new foundation for achieving the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Develop Goals (SDGs).","Documentation":"https://github.com/thu-hanliu/sdc/blob/main/SDC_document.pdf","Contact":"liuhan18@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn","ManagedBy":"Department of Earth System Science, Tsinghua University","UpdateFrequency":"Periodically","Tags":["agriculture","cities","disaster response","earth observation","environmental","geospatial","land","machine learning","mapping","natural resource","satellite imagery","sustainability","urban","water"],"License":"Open to non-commercial uses.","Resources":[{"Description":"Daily Seamless Remote Sensing Data Cube (SDC)","ARN":"arn:aws:s3:::sdc-daily-thu","Region":"us-west-2","Type":"S3 Bucket"}],"DataAtWork":{"Tutorials":[{"Title":"Introduction to Daily SDC on AWS","URL":"https://github.com/thu-hanliu/sdc/blob/main/SDC_document.pdf","AuthorName":"Han Liu","AuthorURL":"https://github.com/thu-hanliu"},{"Title":"Tutorials on how to use Daily SDC on AWS","URL":"https://github.com/thu-hanliu/sdc/blob/main/SDC_tutorial.pdf","AuthorName":"Han Liu","AuthorURL":"https://github.com/thu-hanliu"}]},"RegistryEntryAdded":"2021-01-19","RegistryEntryLastModified":"2021-01-19","Slug":"sdc","Sources":["awslabs-open-data-registry"]}

{"Name":"Yale-CMU-Berkeley (YCB) Object and Model Set","Description":"This project primarily aims to facilitate performance benchmarking in robotics research. The dataset provides mesh models, RGB, RGB-D and point cloud images of over 80 objects. The physical objects are also available via the [YCB benchmarking project](http://www.ycbbenchmarks.com/). The data are collected by two state of the art systems: UC Berkley's scanning rig and the Google scanner. The UC Berkley's scanning rig data provide meshes generated with Poisson reconstruction, meshes generated with volumetric range image integration, textured versions of both meshes, Kinbody files for using the meshes with OpenRAVE, 600 High-resolution RGB images, 600 RGB-D images, and 600 point cloud images for each object. The Google scanner data provides 3 meshes with different resolutions (16k, 64k, and 512k polygons), textured versions of each mesh, Kinbody files for using the meshes with OpenRAVE.","Documentation":"http://www.ycbbenchmarks.com/","Contact":"bcalli@wpi.edu","UpdateFrequency":"Yearly","Tags":["aws-pds","robotics"],"License":"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)","Resources":[{"Description":"Project data files","ARN":"arn:aws:s3:::ycb-benchmarks","Region":"us-east-1","Type":"S3 Bucket","Explore":["[Browse Bucket](https://ycb-benchmarks.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html)"]}],"DataAtWork":{"Publications":[{"Title":"Benchmarking in Manipulation Research: Using the Yale-CMU-Berkeley Object and Model Set","URL":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7254318","AuthorName":"Berk Calli, Aaron Walsman, Arjun Singh, Siddhartha Srinivasa, Pieter Abbeel, Aaron M Dollar","AuthorURL":"https://www.wpi.edu/people/faculty/bcalli"},{"Title":"Label Fusion: A Pipeline for Generating Ground Truth Labels for Real RGBD Data of Cluttered Scenes","URL":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8460950","AuthorName":"Pat Marion, Peter R.
